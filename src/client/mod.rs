//! The client API itself.
//!
//! This contains three main functions that return three specific types of client:
//!
//! * `connect` returns a pair of `Stream` and `Sink`, clients can write RESP messages to the
//! `Sink` and read RESP messages from the `Stream`. Pairing requests to responses is up to the
//! client.  This is intended to be a low-level interface from which more user-friendly interfaces
//! can be built.
//! * `paired_connect` is used for most of the standard Redis commands, where one request results
//! in one response.
//! * `pubsub_connect` is used for Redis's PUBSUB functionality.
